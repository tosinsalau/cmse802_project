## Folder Structure

The following is an overview of the projectâ€™s folder structure, detailing the purpose and contents of each folder:

### 1. `Newspaper`
- **Description**: This folder contains the downloaded Nigerian news sources from LexisNexis.
- **Contents**:
  - The folder is split into five subfolders (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5`).
  - Each subfolder contains approximately 10,000 news stories in JSON format.

### 2. `Converted News`
- **Description**: This folder mirrors the structure of the `Newspaper` folder, but with JSONL files.
- **Contents**:
  - The same news stories from the `Newspaper` folder are converted to JSONL format for easier annotation.
  - The folder has five subfolders (`1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5`) containing the converted news articles.

### 3. `JSONL Output`
- **Description**: This folder contains compressed JSONL news into a single JSONL file for use with the annotation tool Prodigy.
- **Contents**:
  - All the news files in the `Converted News` folder are merged and compressed into six large JSONL files, allowing for efficient annotation during the machine learning process.

### 4. `Annotate`
- **Description**: This folder contains the annotations.
- **Contents**:
  - These files have been labeled and annotated, and they are used as the training data for the machine learning model.

### 5. `Scripts`
- **Description**: This folder contains Python scripts used for data conversion and model training.
- **Contents**:
  - **Conversion Script**: Converts the JSON news files to JSONL format for annotation.
  - **Preprocessing and Training Script**: Preprocesses the annotated files and trains the machine learning model based on the annotated data.
